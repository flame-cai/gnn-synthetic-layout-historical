# Towards Text-Line Segmentation of Historical Documents Using Graph Neural Networks and Synthetic Layout Data


**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** November 14, 2025

### **Project Components**

*   **📁 Dataset:** 15 Sanskrit Manuscripts, 481 pages, with diverse layouts, annotated in graph based and PAGE-XML format
*   **⚙️ Synthetic Data Generator:** Generate synthetic layout data simulating complex layouts in the graph based format
*   **💻 Source Code:** Coming Soon!


### **TODO List**
*   [x] Train and evaluate GNN models on the Sanskrit dataset and synthetic data.
*   [x] Release model weights, and training/inference code for GNN model
*   [x] Integrate GNN model into the manuscript layout analysis tool. Link: [Manuscript Annotation Tool](https://github.com/flame-cai/win64-local-ocr-tool/tree/GNN-DEV-MAIN).
